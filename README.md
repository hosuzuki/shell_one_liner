## regular expressions (a.k.a. regex, regexp, or r.e.)

A regular expression is a pattern that matches strings or pieces of strings. 

| example | explanation |
| --- | --- |
| ^The   | matches any string that starts with The |
| end$ã€€| matches a string that ends with end |
| abc* | matches a string that has ab followed by zero or more c |
| abc+ | matches a string that has ab followed by one or more c |
| abc? | matches a string that has ab followed by zero or one c |
| abc{2} | matches a string that has ab followed by 2 c |
| abc{2,} | matches a string that has ab followed by 2 or more c |
| abc{2,5} | matches a string that has ab followed by 2 up to 5 c |
| a(bc)* | matches a string that has a followed by zero or more copies of the sequence bc |
| a(bc){2,5} | matches a string that has a followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence bc |
| a(b|c) | matches a string that has a followed by b or c (and captures b or c) |
| a[bc]  | same as previous, but without capturing b or c |
| \d | matches a single character that is a digit |
| \w | matches a word character (alphanumeric character plus underscore) |
| \s | matches a whitespace character (includes tabs and line breaks) |
| . |  matches any character |



## pipe

```bash
echo '1+2' | bc
```
The output is `3`.

`$ echo '1+2'` will simply show `1+2`in the terminal.<br>
The pipe `|` can use the output of command at the lefthand side as an input to the right.

## save the output to a file

```bash
echo '1+2' | bc > output.txt
```
The output `3` will be stored in the file called "output.txt".

`>` is called redirect because it changes the direction of output from a terminal to a file.

## sed
```bash
echo this_is_an_apple | sed 's/an_apple/a_pen/'
```
The output will be `this_is_a_pen`.

## grep
```bash
seq 100 | grep 0
```

`seq` command is used to generate numbers from FIRST to LAST in steps of INCREMENT.
If the FIRST was not indicated, it starts from 1.

`grep` is used to search text and strings in a given file or strings.
In this case, grep command search the number which contain `0` from 1 to 100.
